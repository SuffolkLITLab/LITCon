	<p class="profile_title"><b>Abbey Chappell</b>, LIT Clinic Student</p>
	<p>
		Abbey Chappell is a 3L at Suffolk University Law School. Prior to law school, Abbey graduated from Ohio State University where she studied Criminology and Psychology. She then taught middle school writing and reading for three years in Houston, Texas. Her time in the classroom ultimately cemented her interest in exploring how law and policy could be leveraged to address the way systemic injustices manifest on an individual basis and are perpetuated at a structural level.
	</p>
	<p>
		Abbey works as a legal intern with the Housing Unit of Greater Boston Legal Services assisting with tenant eviction defense. In this role, she was initially introduced to how powerful document automation could be as a tool to extend access to justice to not only unrepresented parties, but to also give the necessary tools to support staff and attorneys with the high volume of clients in need of representation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		At Suffolk, Abbey is a student in the Legal Innovation and Technology (LIT) Clinic. Alongside fellow LIT Clinic member, Claudia Tolosa Tomassini, Abbey has worked to design and develop the lab's usability testing process, aiming to enhance the efficiency of court forms and guided interviews and increase accessibility for pro se litigants. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Following graduation, Abbey hopes to continue exploring how legal innovation and technology can intersect with process improvement and project management practices to expand access to legal information and self-help resources, the delivery of legal services, and collaboration with stakeholders.
